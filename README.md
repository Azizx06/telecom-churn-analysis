#  Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project explores customer churn behavior in a telecom dataset using data exploration, visualization, and a simple predictive model.

The goal is to identify patterns in customer usage and service interactions that may lead to churn, helping telecom providers design better customer retention strategies.

##  Project Objectives

- Understand key drivers of customer churn using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Investigate the role of service plans and customer service interactions.
- Build a baseline churn prediction model using Logistic Regression.

---

##  Techniques Used

- Data cleaning and preprocessing with pandas.
- Feature engineering (`Total_charge`, `High_service_calls`).
- Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Correlation analysis.
- Binary classification using scikit-learn's Logistic Regression.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.
